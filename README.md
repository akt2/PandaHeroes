The Plethysmography Analysis Platform is a program developed to streamline the processing and analysis of waveform files for rodent-scale whole-body plethysmography. It automates the conversion of waveform files to physiological meters and provides a pipeline to easily model and graph those measures. Please refer to the repository's Wiki for more documentation.
